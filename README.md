# password-generator
simple password generator made in bash. free to modify and share but you must give me credit

gs.sh = generates random text.

start.sh = runs gs.sh and outputs random text to terminal and a little "passwords generated".

NOTE: I DO NOT USE THIS TO MAKE MY OWN LOGINS

---------------------------
how to run:

1. download code
2. open terminal to the DIR of the files
3. make sure you set permissions of the files "gs.sh" and "start.sh" to be executable
4. run "./start.sh" in terminal without qoutes 
5. done
